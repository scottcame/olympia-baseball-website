These sunny spring days remind us that summer is not far away...and also that it's time for the Olympia Baseball annual Flower Basket fundraiser.
If you'd like to brighten up your front porch or patio with one or more of these beautiful baskets, and also help support the team, please fill out an
[order form]({{'/flower-basket-order-form.pdf' | relative_url }}) and give it to your favorite Bears player along with your check for $25.
You can also contact Athletic Secretary Brandi Sorem at 360-596-7077 or [via email](mailto:bsorem@osd.wednet.edu) for more information.
