The schedule for the 17u and 15u OBC teams have been loaded to the [program calendar]({{'/calendar' | relative_url }}).

It will be an exciting summer full of a ton of great baseball! Each team will play between 35-40 games, competing in a local HS summer league and in several highly competitive tournaments. The development of our players and the identity of our program will be the focus of our summer program. No one will work and improve like we will in the summer! **Earn It!**
