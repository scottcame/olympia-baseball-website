On Saturday, March 3, teams will have practice at the RAC in Lacey from 9:00 am until around noon.  If the weather cooperates, there will be intrasquad games at Crandall Field from 2:00 until late afternoon.
If Crandall Field is not playable, the intrasquad games will be at the RAC.

Then players, coaches, and families will gather in the OHS Commons for a potluck "First Pitch" dinner to kick off the season.  More details to follow in the coming days...stay tuned!
