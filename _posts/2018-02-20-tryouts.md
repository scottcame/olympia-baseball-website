Tryouts Begin Monday, Feb. 26th! Here are the key points for players to note:

* Tryouts will begin immediately after school on Monday, Feb. 26th at Crandall Field.
* ASB Clearance Packets must be turned in by Friday, Feb. 23rd to ensure eligibility.  See the [OHS Clearance Process page](https://olympia.osd.wednet.edu/our_school/athletics/clearance_process) for more details and to download forms.
* _If students are not cleared, they cannot participate._
* Practices will run from 2:35-5:30 each day. (5:30 is an estimate).
* Times will vary if weather forces us inside. Be alert and flexible to potential changes due to weather.
* Players will be evaluated Monday-Wednesday. The 45-man roster will be posted outside Room 405 Thursday morning.
* Players must have baseball pants, a baseball glove and appropriate shoes (both cleats and athletic flats in the event practice is moved inside).
* [Email Coach Weldon](mailto:dweldon@osd.wednet.edu) for more information.
