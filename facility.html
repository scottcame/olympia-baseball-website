<h4>The Need</h4>

<p>Being able to work on hitting year-round is essential to a baseball player's development.  But the uncovered outdoor batting cages at Crandall Field severely limit practice opportunities in wet and cold weather conditions.  The cages are also worn out
  after many years of use and exposure to the weather.  The program needs a workout facility that is suitable for use year-round, so our hitters and coaches can spend quality off-season time working on swings.</p>

<h4>The Plan</h4>

<p>Coach Weldon and the Olympia Diamond Backers have developed a plan to build a covered practice facility on the site of the current cages.  The 4,000 square foot, modular structure will enable a variety of configurations, to allow multiple hitting stations as well as
  pitching, defensive practice and much more.  It will include a field turf playing surface, upgraded electrical/lighting, and new netting.

  The facility will serve as a focal point for the commitment to excellence and skills development that are at the core of the Olympia Baseball Program's vision for success.  It will be available for players at all age levels
  in the Program for many years to come.</p>

<p>The facility will honor the memory of former Olympia Head Coach and Teacher Todd McDougall.</p>

<h4>How to Help</h4>

<p>The Olympia Diamond Backers have launched a fund-raising campaign for construction of the facility, and we need your help.  We've established baseball-themed tiers for donations, and invite everyone in the Olympia Baseball community to contribute! Members
  of the Triples, Home Run, and Grand Slam clubs will be honored with their names inscribed on a wall of the new facility.
